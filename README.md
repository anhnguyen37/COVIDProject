# COVIDProject

This is my first project exploring SQL and Tableau. I downloaded data on July 8th, 2022 from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

I wanted to explore different COVID statistics between countries and continents. The visualization can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anh.nguyen3125/viz/COVIDProject_16577493073670/COVID-19CasesDeathsandVaccinations
